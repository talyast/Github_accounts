Github Research
In this program we get from Githubs API all information on a user the user submitted.
Search button: We get the information from the githubs API via fetch. than we fatch the repositories and followers
of the user.
If the numbers of the followers/repositories is 0 it will show "no followers/repositories".

Save button: you can save as a "favorite". The program checks if there is such a user in Github - if yes it will
save. If not it will show there is no such user and wont save.
It is not possible to save the same person more than once.
The list of saved is saved on a local server.
A local server saves and keeps the list of names.
We approach the server with a fetch with POST to the router "/save"
On server side there is a global array that saves the name and url.

Delete: delete is done like the save in the server.
Only difference is the path which is /delete and the functionality to delete on not to save
